# ABOUT US
Kick back and relax as our eco-farm's fresh, natural air nurtures you. Come and experience the beauty of nature, be accompanied by our accommodating staff and be at awe of our breath taking view of the sunset. And as the morning rises come and have a hearty breakfast provided to you by our staff, and after your meal come and take a dip in our pool, enjoy and cool off in the crystal clean water.

Here in C-Farm, we have a multi-purpose function hall, six (6) Kubo/room, two (2) open cottages, a camping area for 7-9 tents. We also offer a small hiking track for those who want to live in the moment, and last but not least, a self-filtering track swimming pool which measures 25X50 meters.

C-Farm tries and give the best experiences and bring happy moments to all of our guests by bringing them closer to the outdoors.
